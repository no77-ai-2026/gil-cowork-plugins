"""FastMCP application instance — single shared `mcp` object.

Tools are registered dynamically from the declarative endpoint registry by
:mod:`gil_mcp_cafe24.tools._dispatch`. :mod:`gil_mcp_cafe24.server` imports the tool
modules to populate the registry, then runs the server.

Keeping the instance in its own module avoids a circular import between
``server`` (runs the server) and ``tools.*`` (populate the registry).
